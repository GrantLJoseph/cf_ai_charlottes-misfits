Each player has a hand. In the center of the table are the deck and the stack. Each player must maintain at least three cards in their hand at all times, drawing from the deck whenever their hand drops below 3 cards, unless the desk is empty.

A placement is 1 or more cards. Cards of the same rank can be placed together. A straight of three or more cards can be placed together. Straights and multiple of a kind cannot be combined in the same placement.

At the start of the game, each player draws 9 cards into their hand face down. Each player selects three cards to place face down, without ever getting to see them. These three cards per player are known as that player's hidden reserve.

Each player then looks at their remaining 6 cards and makes three placements. These three placements are their visible reserve. Since each placement can include multiple of a kind or a straight, the player may need to draw from the deck to replenish their hand as they go.

Once the visible reserves are populated and all players have 3 cards in their hand, turns begin. For this single-human version, the user always goes first.

On their turn, a player attempts to make a placement onto the stack next to the deck. If the stack is empty, any placement is valid. Otherwise, the lowest card of the placement must be at least as high as the rank of the card on top of the stack.

Examples:

The top of the stack is a 5. The player can play a 5 or higher.
The top of the stack is a 7. The player can play 3 10s.
The top of the stack is a Jack. The player can play a Jack, Queen, King straight, but not a 10, Jack, Queen straight because 10 is not at least as high as Jack.
Cards of rank 2 are the exception. A card of rank 2 can always be played, serving as something akin to a wild card. As a consequence, a straight starting with a 2 can also always be played.

Aces are also special. Aces can always be played by virtue of being the highest card. They also trigger special behavior; playing an Ace discards everything on the stack from play for the entire rest of the game, permanently shrinking the number of cards in play and making the stack empty. The player also gets to go again, making a second placement. This can be chained, for example allowing players to play 2 Aces and then a third placement all in one turn, so long as it happens in that order.

If a player is unable to make a placement onto the stack, they must take the contents of the stack into their hand.

When the deck is empty, players are unable to draw cards after placing to refill their hand. When their hand is completely empty, the player takes their entire visible reserve into their hand.

When their hand is empty and their visible reserve is gone, the player's turn consists of choosing one card from their hidden reserve to attempt to place. If the one card revealed is illegal to place, the player must take the stack into their hand.

The first player to run out of cards completely, exhausting the deck, and both of their reserves, wins.
